# Youtube

First prototype for a simple Youtube Downloader with a GUI using Tkinter.

To use, must select save destination with browse button. Then, input the url to the youtube video you wish to download and press "enter".

NOTE: must press enter to input video url. Url will appear below input area if done correctly. Future updates will fix this problem.

Add as many links as you would like, then press "Start Download" button.

NOTE: No progress bar yet. You will have to check the save folder to see if videos have been downloaded. Future updates will fix this problem.
